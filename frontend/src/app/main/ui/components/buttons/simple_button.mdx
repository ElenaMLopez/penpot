# SimpleButton

A button is a clickable or tap-able UI element representing an action or providing access to a specific function in an app. It has text or an icon indicating its purpose and is commonly used for form submissions, confirmation, or cancellation actions. Clear labeling, proper sizing, ample padding, and spacing contribute to ensuring accessibility and ease of use.

## Usage

## Where to use

The main button highlights the primary action in a context, being visually distinct (e.g., color, size) from others. Users readily identify it as the key means to accomplish tasks. Proper placement, usually at the bottom right corner, ensures consistency and efficient goal completion.

## When to use

Utilize the main button for vital actions, highlighting priority and clarity. Keep each view or modal limited to one main button, accompanied by fewer secondary ones if needed. This approach promotes intuitive navigation and seamless user experience.
